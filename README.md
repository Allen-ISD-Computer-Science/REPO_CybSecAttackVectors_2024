# Vision Statement
We're working to expose a lack of cybersecurity from our IT. Cybersecurity attack vectors are pathways or methods that malicious actors, often referred to as attackers, employ to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. These vectors encompass various tactics, such as malware, phishing, social engineering, and denial-of-service attacks. Attackers leverage these avenues to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of digital assets. Malicious software can infiltrate systems through email attachments or compromised websites, while phishing relies on deceptive tactics to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information. Social engineering exploits human behavior to gain unauthorized access, and denial-of-service attacks overwhelm a system's resources to disrupt its normal functioning. With this software we will be focussing on spoofing eagle engagement points.
